# Movies-ETL

For this challenge, we help Britta needs to create an automated pipeline for new data. We refactor the code we develop before  to create one function that takes in the three files—Wikipedia data, Kaggle metadata, and the MovieLens rating data—and performs the ETL process by adding the data to a PostgreSQL database.
